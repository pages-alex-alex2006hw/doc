MOSIS does not make the TSMC 180 nm models
publically available.  To run the sample
simulations, point to mosistsmc180 instead.

The models in the other folders are taken from
data published on the MOSIS web site.  Most
of this data is measured from test structures on
fabricated parts.

The mosistsmc180 model file will give results
slower than that produced by TSMC's models in
the simulations shown in the book.  See Section 5.4.6
for more information.
