
Thanks for your interest in the 'at-risk' run with the HP GMOS10
process on June 16. The HSPICE parameters for this technology are
attached below. Initial Magic technology files are available from
the MOSIS Web/FTP site. Please pass this information along to
your design team.

As a reminder, the process will support the MOSIS SCMOS_SUBM rules at
lambda of 0.2u and has four layers of metal with stacked vias. The
mask channel length will be sized to 0.35um. The process will NOT have
the silicide block or linear capacitor options inititally. The design
rules for via3 and metal4 are shown below.

 Via3               Width              2 lambda

                    Spacing            4

                    Overlap by         1
                    Metal3

                    Overlap by         2
                    Metal4

 Metal4             Width              6 lambda

                    Spacing            6

I've included the initial release notes as well as the nominal, fast, and
slow cases for you.  Several blank lines separate each model case.

These notes accompany a distribution of Hewlett-Packard's C/GMOS10QA FET
H-SPICE Level-39 model libraries, Rev. 6.1 dated 5/12/97.


(1) The HSPICE Level-39 models are converted from HP's internal
    version of the public domain BSIM2 model. The models are
    binned according to the following bin-boundaries:

    NMOS L: 0.4, 0.43, 0.45, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.4, 3.0, 5.0 microns.
    NMOS W: 0.5, 0.60, 0.80, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0 microns.

    PMOS L: 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.4, 3.0, 5.0 microns.
    PMOS W: 0.5, 0.80, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 10.0 microns.

(2) Parameters/effects that are modeled differently:

    * Overlap capacitance calculations.

    It appears that HSPICE does not instantiate the overlap capacitances
    by multiplying per-unit values numbers with the effective (AC) gate
    width. To get around this problem, width reduction to the effective
    value is modeled using the parameter XW.

(3) The Level-39 gate capacitance model is known to be inaccurate below
    device threshold, more so when non-zero body bias is present. Setting
    CAPOP=13 is suggested as an alternative for analog applications.
    However, the apparent threshold and body effect reflected in the
    capacitance curves will be different from the DC equation values
    since the Level-13 model does not have the non-uniform doping
    parameter K2.

    SPECTRE users will need to determine an appropriate work-around.
    Please use the "tpd", "cmax" and "cdrain" results in the QA directory
    to verify any changes you make. Please contact us if you need any
    further clarifications.

    These models are being shipped with CAPOP=39.

(4) Please do not attempt to adjust the LD or XW values based on
    photolithography bias-tables.

    The models automatically account for these effects since the test
    devices used in model extraction undergo the same processing as
    product wafers.

(5) The HP models allow a complete set of parameters (CJGW, MJGW, PBGW)
    for the gate-side sidewall junction for source/drain. H-SPICE does
    not, providing only a CJGATE parameter with the built-in potential
    and grading coefficient borrowed from the field-edge (side-wall)
    model.

    Thus there are differences between the simulated input capacitance
    looking into the drain or source terminals. The zero-bias values
    match.
    
(6) There are differences in simulation results under non-zero substrate
    bias for longer-channel devices. The HSPICE results are pessimistic
    by around 10% for very long-channel devices. Please examine the
    "QA.device" file for testname "idsatbb".

(7) HSPICE version 96.1.1 and HP-SPICE version 3.8f were used for QA.
