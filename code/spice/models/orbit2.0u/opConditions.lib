**************** Enviromental and Process Parameters *********************
*
* This file loads the appropriate process file and sets the voltage
* and temperature for the simulation corner specified (e.g. TT, SS, FF).
*
* In this particular example, only TT, SS, and FF environments are
* implemented.  No data was available for fast and slow processes,
* so typical processes are used.  if you have better data available,
* you can call the appropriate models.
*
*   SOME of the useful skews to employ are
*
*	TT    nt, pt, RCtyp     RT, nominal supply 
*       SS    nl, pl, RCslo     Hi temp, lo supply voltage
*       FF    nh, ph, RCfas     Lo temp, hi supply voltage
*       FS    nl, ph, RCtyp     Hi temp, lo supply voltage
*       SF    nh, pl, RCtyp     Lo temp, hi supply voltage
*       SLOW  nt, pt, RCtyp     Hi temp, lo supply voltage
*       FAST  nt, pt, RCtyp     Lo temp, hi supply voltage
*       RACE1 nh, ph, RCslo     Lo temp, hi supply voltage
*       RACE2 nl, pl, RCfas     Hi temp, lo supply voltage
*       
*       TM, SM, FM - devices same as TT, SS, FF but the temp 
*                    is "medium" at 70 which is more likely 
*		     to occur than 125.
*        
*
* Need to define Sup before calling the library with a .lib
* This file sets the supply voltage as a function of the nominal
* supply value 'Sup'.
