MOSIS 250 nm README

Simulations done on models from the T27H
run produce performance comparable to the
180 nm process.  Although the oxide is
a bit thicker, the threshold voltages 
and tau are comparable to the 180 nm 
process.  Moreover, a noise-tolerant precharge
simulation comes out with very poor noise
margins in the 250 nm process.

This directory has been updated to use
the T29U parameters to see if they are
any more realistic.
