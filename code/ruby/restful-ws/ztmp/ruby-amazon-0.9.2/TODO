These are some ideas for new features in future versions.

- XSLT requests.
- Remaining AWSv3 features, such as Web Services for Sellers.
- Allow exchange items to be added to remote shopping cart (undocumented AWS
  feature).
- UTF-8 conversion.
- Allow specification of number of pages or number of results to return.
- ALL_PAGES searches for seller profile searches (page > 1 seems not to work).
- ALL_PAGES searches for 3rd party seller searches.
- Override #to_s and/or #inspect for Response classes; otherwise, we can't see
  their instance variables.
- Improve threaded search performance.
- Page caching doesn't work reliably will ALL_PAGES searches, due to use of
  threads.
- Improve page caching: cache pages _after_ parsing their XML, not before
- have a look at logger.rb for handling debugging messages.

Ideally, however, the library should be rewritten from scratch to work with
AWSv4, otherwise known nowadays as ECS.
