INTRODUCTION
------------

Ruby/Amazon is a Ruby language library that allows the programmer to retrieve
information from the popular Amazon Web site via Amazon Web Services. In
addition to the original amazon.com site, amazon.co.uk, amazon.de, amazon.fr,
amazon.ca and amazon.co.jp are also supported.

This library supports the vast majority of the AWS v3 API. All forms of
product search are implemented, along with the transaction API and the remote
shopping-cart API.

You can generate HTML documentation for this library with the following
command, executed from the directory into which you have untarred the archive:

  rdoc lib

Please see the resulting documentation for full information on how to use this
software.

More features are planned for future versions. See the TODO file.


INSTALLATION
------------

Please see the INSTALL file for details of how to install Ruby/Amazon.
