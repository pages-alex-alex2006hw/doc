\paragraph{Cases}
\bit
\w Examples of \bb{cases} include a single insurance claim, a mortgage
applicatino, a tax return, an order, etc. 
\w Similar cases belong to the same \bb{case type}.
\w Each case has a unique \bb{identity}. 
\w Each case has a \bb{limited lifetime}.
\w Between creation and destruction, a case has a \bb{state}.

\section{Implementation of Workflow Management Systems}


\paragraph{Workflow language} A {\bf workflow language} is a language which
describes a workflow. Its semantics is a {\em workflow graph}.

\paragraph{Workflow graph} A {\bf workflow graph\/} is a directed graph $G =
(V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of {\em nodes} and $E = \{\arc{u, v}\}$ is a
precendence relation.
A {node} has one of the following node types:
  \bit
  \w {\em entry node\/}, denoted by $s \in V$,
  \w {\em exit node\/}, denoted by $t \in V$,
  \w {\em conditional node\/},
  \w {\em work node\/}
  \eit

\paragraph{Workflow process}
A workflow graph is a static entity and when a graph is instantiated and
executed, a dynamic entity, called a {\em workflow process\/} is created.
A {\bb workflow process} is executed by the runtime and has a {\em state\/}. 

\paragraph{Workflow state}
A \bb{workflow state} is one of the following:
\bit
\w {\em suspended}: right after the process is created, it is in a suspended
state 
\w {\em running}: when the runtime is ready for the execution of the process, the
state is changed to {\em running\/} and runtime executes the process
\w {\em sleeping}: when the process is active for some predefined time, the
process is changed to {\em sleeping\/} state and it's swapped out to a disk
