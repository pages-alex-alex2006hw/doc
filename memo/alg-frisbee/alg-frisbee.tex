\section{The Problem}
Given:
\bit
\w a set $C = \{C_0, C_1, \cdots, C_{N-1}\}$ of $N$ cows, where each
    cow, $C_i$, has its 
    weight, height, and strength -- denoted by $W(C_i)$, $H(C_i)$ and $S(C_i)$
respectively
\w the height of Mark $M$
\eit
we want to find a subset $G = \{G_0, G_1, \cdots, G_k\}$ of $C$ such that
following two constraints are satisfied:
\ben
\w (HEIGHT CONSTRAINT) 
    \[\sum_{i=0}^{k} H(G_i) \ge M\]
\w (STRENGTH CONSTRAINT) 
   \[\sum_{i=j+1}^{k} W(G_i) \le S(G_j), \mbox{\ for each\ } 0 \le j \le k\]
\een
Moreover, we want such a subset which would maximize the \bb{safety factor},
which is defined as the weight we can add to the stack of cows without putting
more weight than any of the cow in the stack can handle.


\section{Solution}
We want to solve this problem inductively -- find the best solution which we
can make out of
