\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Definitions of a distributed system}
\subsection{Goals} 
\subsubsection{Making resources accessible}
\bit
\w \textcolor{blue}{resource sharing}
\w allow access to \textcolor{blue}{remote resources}
\eit
\subsubsection{Distribution transparency}
\bit
\w \bb{access transparency}
\w \bb{location transparency}
\w \bb{migration transparency}
\w \bb{relocation transparency}
\w \bb{replication transparency}
\w \bb{concurrency transparency}
\w \bb{failure transparency}

\subsubsection{Openness}
\bit
\w \bb{\textcolor{blue}{open} distributed system}: services are offered
according to \textcolor{red}{\textit{\underline{standard rules} that describe
    the syntax and semantics of those services}}
\w \bb{standard rules}: format, contents, meaning of messages sent/received,
i.e. \textcolor{blue}{protocols}
\w e.g. \bb{IDL (interface definition language)}
\w \textcolor{blue}{separating policty from mechanism}
\eit
\subsubsection{Scalability Problem}
\bit
\w \bb{characteristics of decentralized algorithms}
  \ben
  \w \textcolor{blue}{No machine has complete info about system
    state.} 
  \w \textcolor{blue}{Machines make decisions based only on local info.}
  \w \textcolor{blue}{Failure of one machine does not ruin the algorithm.}
  \w \textcolor{blue}{No implicit assumption that a global clock.}
  \een
\w scaling a distributed system across multiple, independent
administrative domains
  \bit
  \w how to resolve conflicting policies, management, security
  \eit
\w \bb{\textcolor{red}{SCALING TECHNIQUES}} 
  \bit
  \w \textcolor{blue}{\bf{}\#1: hiding communication latencies}:
    \bit
    \w \bb{asynchronous communication}: e.g. future in Scala (nonblocking call +
    callback when done)
    \w \bb{moving computation to client side}: e.g. well-formness of inquiry
    form is done in client (using Javascript) rather than sending the form to
    DB to check the correctness
    \eit
  \w \textcolor{blue}{\bf{}\#2: distribution}: split a compnent into smaller
  parts and distribute it across the system
    \bit
    \w \bb{DNS}: DNS name space is hierchically organized into a tree of
    \bb{domains}, which are divided into nonoverlapping \bb{zones}.
    \w \bb{WWW itself}: conceptually, a massive hypertext system indexed by
    URL but distributed to each machine.
    \eit
  \w \textcolor{blue}{\bf{}\#3: replication}: replicate the same function
  across the system; increases availability and helps to balance the load
  between components
    \bit
    \w \bb{caching}: special form of replication (``copy'' of resource)
    \w (-) \bb{consistency problem}
    \eit
  \eit
\w vertical vs horizontal scaling
\eit
\subsection{Types of distributed systems}
\subsubsection{Distributed computing systems}
\bit
\w \bb{cluster computing systems}: homogeneous
  \bit
  \w single computationally-intensive program is run in parallel on multiple
  machines -- {\em collection of compute nodes controlled by a single master
    node} 
  \w Beowulf, MOSIX
  \eit
\w \bb{grid computing systems}: heterogeneous
  \bit
  \w 
  \eit
\eit
\subsubsection{Distributed information system}
\bit
\w \bb{transaction processing system}
   \bit
   \w \bb{transaction}:
     \bit
     \w \bb{atomic}: appear indivisible
     \w \bb{consistent}: does not violate system invariant
     \w \bb{isolated}: concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other
     \w \bb{durable}: changes are permanent when committed
     \eit
   \eit
\w \bb{enterprise application integration (EAI)}
  \bit
  \w \bb{MoM}
  \w \bb{publish-subscribe system}
  \eit
\w \bb{distributed pervasive system}
   \bit
   \w nodes are not fixed -- come and go
   \w \bb{instability} is the main characteristics (e.g. mobile devices,
   sensors) 
   \w small, battery-powered, mobile, wireless -- mostly
   \w no human administrative control
   \w three requirements for pervasive applications 
     \ben
     \w \textcolor{blue}{embrace contextual changes}: device must be aware
     that its env may change all the time
     \w \textcolor{blue}{encourage ad hoc composition}
     \w \textcolor{blue}{recognize sharing as the default}
     \een
   \w \bb{home systems}
   \w \bb{electronic health care systems}
   \w \bb{sensor networks}
