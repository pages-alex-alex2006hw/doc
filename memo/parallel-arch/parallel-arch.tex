\noindent{\large\bf{}Paralell Architectures}

\paragraph{Why parallel architecture?}
The history of speeding up the computer performance (except for clock rate
improvement thanks to technology scaling) has been driven by following major
architectural innovations:
\bit
\w \bb{bit-level parallelism:} from 4-bit to 64-bit processors; doubling
\bb{the datapath widths} reduces the number of cycles to perform full 32-bit
arithmetic operations; however, further increase in word width is driven
mostly by 1) \bb{improved floating-point representation} and 2) \bb{larger
  address space}; now that we have large address space $2^{64}$, it's unlikely
we will need 128-bit processor any time soon

\w {\bb{instruction-level parallelism:}}
in addition to \bb{pipelining}, {\em multi-issue\/} \bb{superscalar}
processors have becom prevalent; however, increasing the amount of
instruction-level parallelism (deeper pipelines) require every increasing
resources (e.g. {\em more caches\/} and {\em more HW logic for branch
  prediction\/}; since longer pipeline and more-simultaneous-instruction issue
introduces more dependenices resolving this dependencies require a lot of
design effort and HW resources

also, it's been observed that at-most 4-issue superscalar processor is the
sort of limit that we can expect. (8-issue is not much better than 4-issue)

reducing data dependencies can be done by \bb{renaming}, which is simliar to
SSA in compilers

\w \bb{thread-level parallelism:} current trend
\eit

\paragraph{Shared memory multiprocessors}
\bit
\w there is a global physical memory, there is a physical memory region which
is shared by all processors (i.e. some shared portion of virtual address space
of each processor is mapped to these physical pages)
\w \bb{SMP (symmetric multiprocessors)}
\bit
\w bus-based interconnect: not scalable since bandwidth is fixed (adding more
processors reduces ...)
\w crossbar switch
\w multistage interconnection network (butterfly, hypercube, etc.)
\eit
\w \bb{NUMA (non-uniform memory access) MP}
\eit

\paragraph{Message passing multiprocessors}

\paragraph{Data parallel processors}
