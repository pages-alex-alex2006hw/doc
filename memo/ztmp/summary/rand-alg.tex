\bit
\w \bb{Las Vegas algorithm}: always gives the correct solution.
    only variation from one run to another is its \bb{running time}.
\w \bb{Monte Carlo algorithm}: sometimes gives an incorrect solution
    but the probability of an error is bounded.
   \bit
   \w through \bb{repetition}, we can make the failure probability arbitrarily
   small 
   \w \bb{one-sided error Monte Carlo algorithm}: probabilty that it errs is
   zero for at least one of the possible outputs (YES/NO)
   \w \bb{two-sided error Monte Carlo algorithm}: non-zero probability when it
   outputs either YES or NO
   \eit
\w Las Vegas algorithm is \bb{efficient} if its {\em expected\/} running time
is bounded by a polynomial
\w Monte Carlo algorithm is \bb{efficient} if its {\em worst-case\/} running
time is bounded by a polynomial
