\section{ALGORITHM DESIGN}
\subsection{Dynamic programming}
\bit
\w While \bb{divide-and-conquer} algorithm is used when subproblems
are \bb{independent}, \bb{dynamic programming} algorithm is used when
subproblems are \bb{dependent}. That is, dynamic programming is used
when subproblems \bb{SHARE} subsubproblems.
\w In dynamic programming, 
we {\em solve  shared subproblems only once\/} and keep the solutions
to the solved subproblems in a table so that they can be looked up later.

\w (EXAMPLE: \bb{matrix multiplication}) min cost of parenthesizing the
product $A_i\cdots A_j$, where $A_l$ has dimension $p_{l-1}\times p_l$, is
\[ m[i, j] = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
   0 & \mbox{if\ } i = j,\\
   \min_{i \le k < j}\{m[i, k] + m[k+1,j] + p_{i-1}p_kp_j\} & \mbox{if\ } i <
   j,\\ 
	    \end{array}\right.\]
