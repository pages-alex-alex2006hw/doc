\w \bb{Parenthesis theorem}: in any DFS of a graph $G = (V, E)$,
  for any two vertices $u$ and $v$, exactly one of the following three
  conditions hold:
  \ben
  \w [(a)] the intervals $[d(u), f(u)]$ and $[d(v), f(v)]$ are entirely
  disjoint,
  \w [(b)] the internval $[d(u), f(u)]$ is entirely contained in $[d(v),
    f(v)]$ and $u$ is a descendant of $v$ in the DFS-tree, or
  \w [(c)] the internval $[d(v), f(v)]$ is entirely contained in $[d(u),
    f(u)]$ and $v$ is a descendant of $u$ in the DFS-tree.
