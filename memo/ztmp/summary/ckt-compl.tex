\section{CIRCUIT COMPLEXITY}
\subsection{Alternating Turing machines}
\bit
\w Circuit size can be related to Turing machine time and circuit dept can be
related to Turing machine space. But, this does not well reflect the
parallelism inherent in circuit computation.
\w An \bb{altenate Turing machine (ATM)} is a Turing machine with \bb{state
  type function} $g: Q \rightarrow \{\wedge, \vee, 0, 1\}$.
