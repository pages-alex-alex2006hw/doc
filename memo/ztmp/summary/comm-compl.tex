\section{COMMUNICATION COMPLEXITY}
\subsection{Basic Model}
\bit
\w Let $X, Y, Z$ be arbitrary sets and $f: X \times Y \rightarrow Z$ be an
arbitary function. Two players, ALICE and BOB, wish to evaluate $f(x, y)$,
for some inputs $x \in X, y \in Y$.  \bb{ALICE only knows $x$ and BOB only
  knows $y$}. They need to communicate to evaluate function,  using some
protocol $\cal P$ (which only depends on $f$). 
\w A \bb{protocol} $\cal P$ over domain $X \times Y$ with range $Z$ is a
binary tree where each internal node $v$ is labeled either by a function $a_v:
X \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ or by a function $b_v: Y \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$, and
each leaf is labeled with an element $z \in Z$.
\w For a function $f: X \times Y \rightarrow Z$, the \bb{(deterministic)
  communication complexity} $D(f)$ of $f$ is minimum cost of $\cal P$, over
all protocols $\cal P$ that compute $f$. 
\w $D(f) \le \lg |X| + \lg |Y|$.\ \  (when either ALICE or BOB simply sends the input
he/she knows)

\subsection{Rectangles}
\bit
\w View protocols as a \bb{way to partition the space of all possible input
  pairs}, $X \times Y$, into sets such that {\em for all input pairs in the
  same set the smae communication is sent during the execution of the
  protocol\/}.
