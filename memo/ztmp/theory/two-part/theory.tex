\section{Elementary Language Theory}
\subsection{Languages and Grammars}
\bit
\w {\em{}Language\/} $L$ is a set of finite strings over some finite alphabet
	$\Sigma$.
\w A {\em{}grammar\/} is a $4$-tuple $G = (N, T, P, S)$ where
	\ben	
	\w [(a)] $N$ is a finite set of {\bf{}nonterminal symbols}
		(a.k.a. {\em{}variables\/} or {\em{}syntactic categories\/}).
	\w [(b)] $T$ is a finite set of {\bf{}terminal symbols}.
		disjoint from $N$.
	\w [(c)] $P$ is a finite subset of 
		\[ (N \cup T)^*N(N \cup T)^* \times (N \cup T)^*, \]
		An element $(\alpha, \beta) \in P$ will be written 
		$\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ and called a {\bf{}production}.
	\w [(d)] $S$ is a distinguished symbol in $N$ called the {\bf{}start
		symbol} (a.k.a. {\em{}sentence symbol\/}).
	\een
\w A grammar defines a language in a recursive manner.
\w A {\bf{}sentential form} of a grammar $G = (N, T, P, S)$ is defined
	as follows:
	\ben
	\w [(a)] $S$ is a sentential form.
	\w [(b)] If $\alpha\beta\gamma$ is a sentential form and
		$\beta \rightarrow \delta \in P$, then
		$\alpha\delta\gamma$ is also a sentential form.
	\een
\w A sentential form with no nonterminal symbols is called a
	{\bf{}sentence} generated by $G$.
\w The {\bf{}language generated by a grammar} $G$, denoted $L(G)$, is
	the set of sentences generated by $G$.
\w We define a relation $\Ra_G$ (read as {\bf{}directly derives})
	as follows:
	If $\alpha\beta\gamma$ is a string in $(N \cup T)^*$
	and $\beta \rightarrow \delta$ is a production in $P$, then
	$\alpha\beta\gamma \Rightarrow_G \alpha\delta\gamma$.
	\bit
	\w $\Ra^+_G$ is the transitive closure of $\Ra_G$.
	\w $\Ra^*_G$ is the reflexive and transitive closure of $\Ra_G$.
	\w $\Ra^k_G$ is the $k$-fold product of $\Ra_G$.
	\w $\Ra_G$ is usually written as $\Ra$ when $G$ is clear from
		the context.
	\eit
\w $L(G) = \{w : w \in T^* \mbox{\ and\ } S \Rightarrow^* w\}$.
\eit

\subsection{Restricted grammars}
\bit
\w Let $G = (N, T, P, S)$ be a grammar. $G$ is said to be
	\ben
	\w {\bf{}right-linear} if each production in $P$ is of the form
		$A \rightarrow xB$ or $A \rightarrow x$ where
		$A, B \in N$ and $x \in T^*$.
	\w {\bf{}context-free} if each production in $P$ is of the form
		$A \rightarrow \alpha$, where
		$A \in N$ and $\alpha \in (N \cup T)^*)$.\
	\w {\bf{}context-sensitive} if each production in $P$ is of the
		form $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$, where $|\alpha| \le
		|\beta|$.
	\w {\bf{}unrestricted} if $G$ has no restrictions given above.

\section{Finite Automata and Regular Expressions}
\subsection{Deterministic Finite Automata}
\begin{itemize}
\item We denote a {\bf{}$($deterministic$)$ finite automaton} by a 
	5-tuple $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where $Q$ is a finite
	set of {\em{}states\/}, $\Sigma$ is a finite {\em{}input alphabet\/},
	$q_0 \in Q$ is the {\em{}initial state\/}, $F \subseteq Q$ is the
	set of {\em{}final states\/}, and $\delta$ is the {\em{}transition
	function\/} mapping $Q\times\Sigma$ to $Q$.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$: in \cite{HU79},
		$\delta$ is defined as a {\bf{}total function}
	\item $|F| \ge 1$
	\end{itemize}
\item Extending $\delta$ to $\hat\delta: Q\times\Sigma^* \rightarrow Q$
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] $\hat\delta(q, \epsilon) = q$, 
	\item [(b)] $\hat\delta(q, wa) = \delta(\hat\delta(q, w), a)$
	\end{enumerate}
\item A string $x$ is said to be {\bf{}accepted} by a finite automaton
	$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ if 
	$\delta(q_0, x) = p$ for some $p \in F$.
\item The {\bf{}language accepted\footnote{In \cite{Sipser96}, to avoid
	the confusion incurred by the fact that both strings and languages
	are `accepted' by machines, Sipser suggested that `{\bf{}recognized}'
	should be used instead of `accepted' in this case.} 
	by $M$}, designated $L(M)$, is the
	set $\{x: \delta(q_0, x) \in F\}$.
\item A langauge is a {\bf{}regular set} (or just {\bf{}regular}) 
	if it is the set accepted by some finite automaton.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Nondeterministic Finite Automata}
\begin{itemize}
\item A {\bf{}nondeterministic finite automaton} is a $5$-tuple
	$(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where 
	$\delta$ is a map from $Q \times \Sigma$ to $2^Q$.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Note that $\delta(q, a)$ can be $\emptyset$ and $\delta$ is
		a {\em{}total function\/}.
	\end{itemize}
\item Extending $\delta$ to $\hat\delta: Q\times\Sigma^* \rightarrow 2^Q$
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] $\hat\delta(q, \epsilon) = q$, 
	\item [(b)] $\hat\delta(q, wa) =
		\{p: \mbox{for some state $r \in \hat\delta(q, w)$, 
		$p \in \delta(r, a)$}\}$, i.e.
		\[ \hat\delta(q, wa) = \bigcup_{r \in \hat\delta(q, w)} \delta(r, a)\]
	\end{enumerate}
\item Let's use $\delta$ in place of $\hat\delta$ for convenience.
\item Extending $\delta$ to $\delta: 2^Q\times\Sigma^* \rightarrow 2^Q$
	\[\delta(P, w) = \bigcup_{q \in P} \delta(q, w).\]
\item $L(M)$, the {\bf{}language accepted by} an NFA
	is 
	\[\{w: \delta(q_0, w) \mbox{\ contains a state in $F$}\},\] 
	i.e.,
	\[ \{w: \delta(q_0, w) \cap F \ne \emptyset\} \]
\item ({\bf{}Equivalence of DFA's and NFA's})
	Let $L$ be a set accepted by a nondeterministic
		finite automaton. Then there exists a deterministic finite automaton
		that accepts $L$.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$: an NFA accepting $L$.
	\item $M' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0', F')$: a DFA accepting $L$.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $Q' = 2^Q$
		\item $\delta'([q_1, \cdots, q_k], a) = [p_1, \cdots, p_l]$ iff
			$\delta(\{q_1, \cdots, q_k\}, a) = \{p_1, \cdots, p_l\}$
		\item $q_0' = [q_0]$
		\item $F' = [q \in Q': (\exists{f \in F})[f \in q]]$
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nondeterministic Finite Automata with $\epsilon$-moves}
\begin{itemize}
\item A {\bf{}nondeterministic finite automaton with $\epsilon$-moves}
	is a quintuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ with all components
	as before, but $\delta$ maps $Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\})$
	to $2^Q$.
\w $\epsilon$-CLOSURE$(q)$ is the set of states reachable from $q$
	using $\epsilon$-transitions only.
\w Extending $\delta$ to $\hat\delta: Q\times\Sigma^* \ra 2^Q$
	\bit
	\w [(a)] $\hat\delta(q, \epsilon) = \epsilon\mbox{-CLOSURE}(q)$
	\w [(b)] $\hat\delta(q, wa) = \epsilon\mbox{-CLOSURE}(P)$, where
		$P = \{p: (\exists{}r\in\hat\delta(q, w))[p \in \delta(r, a)]\}$, 
			i.e.,
			\[ \hat\delta(q, wa) = 
			\epsilon\mbox{-CLOSURE}(\delta(\hat\delta(q, w), a))\]
	\eit
\w Extending $\delta$ and $\hat\delta$ 
	to $\delta,\hat\delta: 2^Q\times\Sigma^* \ra 2^Q$
	\bit
	\w [(a)] $\delta(R, a) = \bigcup_{q \in R}\delta(q, a)$
	\w [(b)] $\delta(R, w) = \bigcup_{q \in R}\hat\delta(q, a)$
	\eit
\w Note that {\em\bfseries{}$\hat\delta(q, a)$ is not necessarily equal to 
	$\delta(q, a)$\/} because of the $\epsilon$-transitions.
\w $L(M)$ , the {\em{}language accepted by a nondeterministic finite automaton
	with $\epsilon$-moves\/} is defined to be 
	$\{w: \hat\delta(q_0, w) \cap F \ne \emptyset\}$.
\w ({\bf{}Equivalence of NFA's with and without $\epsilon$-moves})
	If $L$ is accepted by an NFA with $\epsilon$-transitions, 
		then $L$ is accepted by an NFA without $\epsilon$-transitions.
	\bit
	\w $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$: an NFA with $\epsilon$-moves
	\w $M' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0', F')$: an NFA without $\epsilon$-moves
		\bit
		\w $Q' = Q$
		\w $\delta'(q, a) = \hat\delta(q, a)$
		\w $q_0' = q_0$
		\w $F' = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
			F \cup \{q_0\} & \mbox{if $\epsilon$-CLOSURE($q_0$) contains
				a state of $F$,} \\
			F & \mbox{otherwise}
			\end{array}\right.$
		\eit
	\eit
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Regular Expressions}
\begin{itemize}
\w $RS$ is defined
			to be $\{xy : x \in R \mbox{\ and\ } y \in S\}$, 
			$R^* = \bigcup_{i = 0}^\infty{R^i}$
\w $R^0 = \{\epsilon\}$, \ $R^i = RR^{i-1}$ $(i \ge 1)$
\item Given an alphabet $\Sigma$, 
	{\bf{}regular expressions over $\Sigma$} is 
	defined recursively as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] $\emptyset$ is a regular expression, and 
		$L(\emptyset) = [\![\emptyset]\!] = \emptyset$\footnote{In the
		statement $L(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, note that the first
		$\emptyset$ is just a ``symbol'' while the second one is the 
		empty set.}
	\item [(b)] $\epsilon$ is a regular expression, and $L(\epsilon) = 
		\{\epsilon\}$
	\item [(c)] $a \in \Sigma$ is a regular expression, and 
		$L(a) = \{a\}$
	\item [(d)] If $r, s$ are  regular expressions 
		denoting $R$ and $S$, respectively, then $r+s, rs, r^*$ are 
		regular expressions, and $L(r+s) = R \cup S$, 
		$L(rs) = RS$, $L(r^*) = R^*$
	\end{enumerate}
\w Note that $r\emptyset = \emptyset{r} = \emptyset$ 
	and $\emptyset^* = \{\epsilon\}$.
\w ({\bf{}Equivalence of regular expressions and NFA's 
	with $\epsilon$-transitions})
	Let $r$ be a regular expression. Then there exists an NFA with
	$\epsilon$-transitions that accepts $L(r)$.
	\bit
	\w Use {\em{}Thompson's construction}
	\eit
\w ({\bf{}Equivalence of DFA's and regular expressions}) 
	If $L$ is accepted by the DFA then $L$ is denoted by a regular
	expression.
	\bit
	\w $M = (\{q_1, \cdots, q_n\}, \Sigma, \delta, q_1, F)$
	\w $R^k_{ij}$: the set of all strings $x$ s.t. $\delta(q_i, x) = q_j$,
		and if $\delta(q_i, y) = q_l$, for any
			$y$ that is a prefix of $x$, other than $x$ or 
			$\epsilon$,
			then $l \le k$; that is, 
			{\sl\bfseries{}$R^k_{ij}$ is the
			set of strings that take the finite automaton from 
			state
			$q_i$ to state $q_j$ without going through any state
			numbered higher than $k$}
	\w We can define $R^k_{ij}$ recursively:
		\begin{eqnarray*}
		R^k_{ij} & = & R^{k-1}_{ik}(R^{k-1}_{kk})^*R_{kj}^{k-1} 
			\cup R_{ij}^{k-1},\\
		R^0_{ij} & = & 
			\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
			\{a: \delta(q_i, a) = q_j\} & i \ne j\\
			\{a: \delta(q_i, a) = q_j\} \cup \{\epsilon\} & i = j\\
			\end{array}\right.
		\end{eqnarray*}
	\w Now what's left is to show that for each $i, j, k$, there exists
		a regular expression denoting the language $R^k_{ij}$, which
		can be proved using induction.
	\w To finish the proof, we have only to observe that
		\[ L(M) = \bigcup_{q_j \in F} R^n_{1j} \]
	\eit
\w The proof of equivalence of DFA, NFA, $\epsilon$-NFA, and regex was
	carried out according to the following scheme:
	\[\xymatrix@-1.0pc{
	& \mbox{NFA} \ar@/_3ex/[ld] & \\
	\mbox{DFA} \ar@/_3ex/[rd] & & \mbox{$\epsilon$-NFA} 
			\ar@/_3ex/[ul] \\
	& \mbox{Regex} \ar@/_3ex/[ru] &
	}\]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Two-way Finite Automata}
\bit
\w NFA: adds {\em{}nondeterminism\/} to the model; allows
	{\em{}many ``copies'' of the control unit to exist and scan the tape
		simulataneously\/}
\w NFA with $\epsilon$-moves: allows {\em{}change of state without reading the
	input and moving the head\/}
\w Two-way finite automata (2DFA) : allows the tape head to move left as well
\w A {\bf{}two-way deterministic finite automaton} (2DFA) is a quintuple
	$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where $Q, \Sigma, q_0, F$ are as
	before, and $\delta$ is a map from $Q \times \Sigma$ to
	$Q \times \{\mbox{L, R}\}$.
\w An {\bf{}instantaneous description} (ID) of a 2DFA is a string
	in $\Sigma^*Q\Sigma^*$.
	\bit
	\w Unlike DFA's, just extending $\delta$ to `$\hat\delta$' is not enough to
		describe the behavior of 2DFA. 
	\w ID describes the {\em{}input string, current state\/}, and the 
		{\em{}current position of the tape head\/}.
	\w $\vdash_M$ or $\vdash$ as a transition relation on the set of ID's
		\ben

\subsection{Finite Automata with Output}
\bit
\w Two finite automata with output
	\bit
	\w {\em{}Moore machine} associates output with {\em{}states\/}.
	\w {\em{}Mealy machine} associates output with {\em{}transitions\/}.
	\eit
\w A {\bf{}Moore machine} is a $6$-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \Delta, 
	\delta, \lambda, q_0)$, where $Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0$ are as in the DFA
	and $\Delta$ is the {\em{}output alphabet\/} and $\lambda$ is the
	{\em{}output function\/}.
	\bit
	\w $\lambda: Q \rightarrow \Delta$ associates each state with output.
	\eit
\w A {\bf{}Mealy machine} is a $6$-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \Delta, 
	\delta, \lambda, q_0)$, where $Q, \Sigma, \Delta, \delta, q_0$ are as 
	in the Moore machine and $\lambda$ is the {\em{}output function\/}.
	\bit
	\w $\lambda: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow \Delta$ 
		associates each transition with output.
	\eit
\w If we may neglect the response of a Moore machine to input
	$\epsilon$ then Mealy machine $M_1$ and Moore machine $M_2$
	are {\bf{}equivalent} if for all inputs $w$, 
	$bT_{M_1}(w) = T_{M_2}(w)$, where $b$ is the output of $M_2$
	for its initial state\footnote{$T_M(w)$ is the output of $M$ on $w$.}.

\section{Properties of Regular Sets}
\subsection{The Pumping Lemma for Regular Sets}
\bit
\w ({\bf{}Pumping Lemma}) {\em{}Let $L$ be a regular set. Then there is
	a constant $n$ s.t. if $z$ is any word in $L$, and $|z| \ge n$,
	we may write $z = uvw$ in such a way that
	$|uv| \le n$, $|v| \ge 1$, and for all $i \ge 0$, 
	$uv^iw$ is in $L$. Furthermore, $n$ is no greater than
	the number of states of the smallest FA accepting $L$.}
\w The pumping lemma means that given any sufficiently long string
	accepted by an FA, we can find a substring near the beginning
	of the string that may be ``pumped'', i.e. repeated as many times
	as we like, and the resulting string will be accepted by the FA.
\w {\bf{}Using pumping lemma to prove the nonregularities of languages}
	\ben
	\w Select the language $L$ you wish to prove nonregular.
	\w The ``adversary'' picks $n$, the constant mentioned in the
		pumping lemma.
	\w Select a string $z \in L$. The choice may depend implicitly
		on the value of $n$.
	\w The adversary breaks $z$ into $u, v$, and $w$, subject to 
		the constraints that $|uv| \le n$ and $|v| \ge 1$.
	\w You achieve a contradiction to the pumping lemma by
		showing, for any $u, v$, and $w$ determined by
		the adversary, that there exists an $i$ for which
		$uv^iw$ is not in $L$. It may then be concluded that
		$L$ is not regular. Selection of $i$ may depend on
		$n, u, v$, and $w$.
	\een
\w {\em{}Example\/}. The set $L = \{0^n1^n: i \mbox{\ is an integer and\ }
	i \ge 1\}$ is not regular.
	\ben
	\w Assume that $L$ is regular and the pumping lemma holds for $L$.
	\w Let $n$ be the {\bf{}pumping length}.
	\w Let $z = 0^p1^p$.
	\w By the pumping lemma $z = 0^p1^p = uvw$, where $1 \leq |v| \le n$
		and $uv^iw \in L$ for all $i$.
	\w We consider three cases:
		\bit
		\w The string $v$ consists only of $0$s; 
			then $uv^2w$ has more $0$s than $1$s.
		\w The string $v$ consists only of $1$s
			then $uv^2w$ has more $1$s than $0$s.
		\w The string $v$ consists of $0$s and $1$s; then 
			$uv^w$ may have some $1$s before $0$s.
		\eit
	\w $L$ is not regular.
	\een
\w {\em{}Example\/}. The set $L = \{0^{i^2}: i \mbox{\ is an integer and\ }
	i \ge 1\}$ is not regular.
	\ben
	\w Assume that $L$ is regular and the pumping lemma holds for $L$.
	\w Let $n$ be the integer in the pumping lemma.
	\w Let $z = 0^{n^2}$.
	\w By the pumping lemma $0^{n^2} = uvw$, where
		$1 \leq |v| \le n$ and $uv^iw$ is in $L$ for all $i$.
	\w In particular, let $i = 2$. However, 
		\[ n^2 < |uv^2w| \le n^2 + n < (n+1)^2 \]
		since $|v| \ge 1$.
		That is, the length of $uv^2w$ lies properly between $n^2$
		and $(n+1)^2$, and thus is not a perfect square.
	\w $L$ is not regular.

\subsection{Closure Properties of Regular Sets}
\bit
\w If a class of languages is closed under a particular
	{\em{}operation\/}, we call that fact a {\bf{}closure property}
	of the {\em{}class of languages\/}.
\w The regular sets are closed under {\bf{}union}, {\bf{}concatenation} and
	{\bf{}Kleene closure} operations.
\w The class of regular sets is closed under {\bf{}complementation}.
	That is, if $L$ is a regular set and $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$,
	then $\overline{L} = \Sigma^* - L$ is a regular set.
	\bit
	\w To accept $\overline{L}$, complement the final states of 
		$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where $M$ is

	\eit
\w The regular sets are closed under {\bf{}intersection}.

\w A {\bf{}substitution} $f$ is a mapping of an alphabet $\Sigma$
	onto subsets of $\Delta^*$, for some alphabet $\Delta$.
	\bit
	\w $f$ associates a {\em regular \bfseries{}language\/} 
		with each symbol of $\Sigma$.
	\eit
\w The class of regular sets are closed under substitution.
\w A {\bf{}homomorphism} $h$ is a substitution s.t.
	$h(a)$ contains a single string for each $a$.
	\bit
	\w We generally take $h(a)$ to be the string itself rather than
		the set containing that string.
	\w The {\bf{}inverse homomorphic image} of a language $L$ is 
		\[ h^{-1}(L) = \{x: h(x) \in L\}. \]
	\w For a srting $w$, $h^{-1}(w) = \{x: h(x) = w\}$.
	\eit
\w The class of regular sets is closed under homomorphism and 
	inverse homomorphism.
\w A {\bf{}quotient} of languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, written
	$L_1 / L_2$, is defined to be
		\[ \{x: \mbox{\ there exists $y \in L_2$ s.t. $xy \in L_1$}\}.\]
\w The class of regular sets is closed under quotient wit
	arbitrary sets.

\subsection{Context-Free Grammars}
\bit
\w A {\bf{}context-free grammar} (or CFG) is denoted by

	of {\bf{}variables} and {\bf{}terminals}
	\bit
	\w $V$ and $T$ are disjoint.
	\w $P$ is a finite of set of {\bf{}productions}; a production
		is of the form $A \rightarrow \alpha$ where $A$ is a
		vaariable and $\alpha \in (V \cup T)^*$.
	\w $S$ is a special variable called the {\bf{}start symbol}.
	\eit
\w If $A \rightarrow \beta$ is a production of $P$ and $\alpha, \gamma$
	are any strings in $(V \cup T)^*$, then
	$\alpha{A}\gamma \Rightarrow \alpha\beta\gamma$.
	\bit
	\w We say that $\alpha{A}\gamma$ {\bf{}directly derives}
		$\alpha\beta\gamma$.
	\eit
\w $\stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow}$ is the reflexive, transitive closure
	of $\Rightarrow$.
\w A string of terminals and variables $\alpha$ is called a 
	{\bf{}sentential form} if $S \stackrel{*}{\Ra} \alpha$.
\w The {\bf{}language generated by} $G$, $L(G)$, 
	is $\{w: w \in T^* \mbox{\ and\ } S \stackrel{*}{\Ra} w\}$.
\w We call $L$ a {\bf{}context-free language} (CFL) if it is
	$L(G)$ for some CFG $G$.

\subsection{Derivation Trees}
\bit

	tree} (or {\bf{}parse tree}) if 
	\ben
	\w [(a)] Every vertex has a {\em{}label\/}, which is a symbol
		of $V \cup T \cup \{\epsilon\}$.
	\w [(b)] The label of the root is $S$.
	\w [(c)] If a vertex is interior and has label $A$, then 
		$A$ must be in $V$.
	\w [(d)] If a vertex $n$ has label $A$ and vertices $n_1, \cdots, 
		n_k$ are the children of $n$, in order from the left, with
		labels $X_1, \cdots, X_k$, respectively, then
			\[ A \rightarrow X_1\cdots{X_k} \]
			must be a production in $P$.
	\w [(e)] If a vertex $n$ has label $\epsilon$, then $n$ is a 
		leaf and is the only child of its father.
	\een
\w If we read the leaves from left to right, we have a sentential
	form. We call this string the {\bf{}yield} of the derivation tree.
\w Let $G = (V, T, P, S)$ be a context-free grammar. Then 
	$S \stackrel{*}{\Ra} \alpha$ if and only if there is a derivation
	tree in grammar $G$ with yield $\alpha$.
\w {\bf{}Leftmost and rightmost derivation}
	\bit
	\w If at each step in a derivation a production is applied to
		the {\em{}leftmost\/} variable, then the derivation is
		said to be {\bf{}leftmost}. (Rightmost derivation
			is defined similarly.)
	\w If $w \in L(G)$ for some CFG $G$, then $w$ has {\em{}at least}
		one parse tree.
	\w For a particular parse tree, {\em{}exactly one\/} leftmost
		derivation and {\em{}exactly one\/} derivation is associated 
		with the tree.
	\w A context-free grammar $G$ s.t. some word has more than two
		parse trees is said to be {\bf{}ambiguous}.

	\bit
	\w Earley's algorithm solves this problem in $O(n^3)$ time in general,
		and $O(n^2)$ on unambiguous CFG, but actually linear
		on a wide variety of useful grammars.
