[Caches]

Larger blocks
-------------
1. larger blocks take advantage of *spatial locality*
   - single block contains more words

2. larger blocks increase the miss rate
   - # blocks in the cache is reduced
   - more conflict misses and capacity misses

Therefore, do 1. as long as 2. does not apply
