\section{Elementary Graph Algorithms}
\bit
\w A \bb{graph} 
   $G = (V, E)$ is a set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$ of edges such
   that an edge $(u, v) \in E$ is a pair of vertices in $V$.
   We represent the number of vertices by $n$ and the number of edges by $e$.
\w A \bb{dense} graph is one where $n$ is close to $e$ and a \bb{sparse} 
   graph is one where $n <\!\!\!< e$.
\w The \bb{incidence matrix} of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a $n \times e$ matrix
   $B = (b_{ij})$ such that
   \[ b_{ij} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
        -1 & \mbox{if edge $j$ leaves vertex $i$},\\
        0 & \mbox{if edge $j$ is not incident to vertex $i$},\\
        1 & \mbox{if edge $j$ enters vertex $i$}.
		   \end{array}\right. 
\]

\w \bb{(Square)} 
   A \bb{square} of a {\em directed graph\/} $G = (V, E)$ is the graph $G^2 =
   (V, E^2)$ such that $(u, w) \in E^2$ if and only if for some $v \in V$, 
   both $(u, v) \in E$ and $(v, w) \in E$.  That is, $G^2$ contains an edge
   between $u$ and $w$ whenever $G$ contains a path exactly two edges on it.

\w \bb{(Adjacency power)} $G^n = (V, E^n)$ is an \bb{$n$th 
   adjacency power} of $G$, where $(u, v) \in E^n$ if and only if $G$ contains
   a length-$n$ path from $u$ to $v$. 
   When $(a_{ij})^n$ is the adjacency matrix for $G^n$,
   \[ a_{ij}^n = \sum_{k = 1}^na_{ik}^{n-1}a_{kj}. \]

\w \bb{(Celebrity problem)} A vertex $v$ in $G$ is a \bb{universal sink} if
   $indeg(v) = n - 1$ and 
   $outdeg(v) = 0$. When an adjacency matrix is used to represent $G$, we can
   find universal sink in $O(n)$ time.

\subsection{Breadth-first search}
\bit
\w Breadth-first search algorithm discovers all vertices at distance $k$
   before discovering any vertices at distance $k+1$. 
\w Breadth-first search algorithm visits all the {\em reachable\/} vertices
   and computes \bb{shortest-path} distance from the {\em source vertex\/}.
