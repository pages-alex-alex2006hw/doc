\section{LCF}
LCF (Logic of Computable Functions) uss an \bb{abstract data type} 
whose predefined values are instances of axioms and whose operations are 
inference rules; then, strict \bb{typechecking} ensures that the only values
that could be created were those obtainable from axioms by applying a sequence
of inference rules.
