CASH is a reconfigurable architecture which synthesizes asynchronous circuits
from C programs.

\subsection{Pegasus intermediate representation}
The Pegasus representation extends SSA to 
extends SSA to handle memory dependencies, predication, and forward
  speculation.
It is a directed graph, where nodes are {\em operations\/} and edges
represent {\em value flows\/}.
The graph can be partitioned into hyperblocks and
an hyperblock, in turn, consists of basic blocks.
An hyperblock is transformed into straight-line code using predication
and speculation introduced by \bb{predicate promotion}. 

In particular, a Pegasus node has one of the following node types:
     \bit
     \w \bb{ETA node (a.k.a. gateway)}: has two inputs, \bb{value} and
     \bb{predicate}, and one output
     \w \bb{MERGE node}: receives control from one of several different
     points 
     \w \bb{LOAD/STORE nodes}: memory access
     \w \bb{CALL node}: predicated (may have side-effect)
     \w \bb{DIVISION node}: predicated (may have side-effect)
     \w \bb{COMBINE node}: SSA $\phi$-operator
     \eit
