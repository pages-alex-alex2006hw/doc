\section{Introduction}
A system can be described in a static way. For example, a sytem can be
described as a finite state machine. This finite state machine abstracts and 
represents the given system. 
This finite state mahcines has a behavior. Behavior is defined with respect to
a formal semantics: an example is a set of all possible state sequences
reachable from the initial state. 

However, the state machine is descriptive by nature. It describes a system but
does not show the implementation.
