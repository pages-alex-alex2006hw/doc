\section{Azul Systems: Vega Appliances}
Vega~3 processor is a 54-core chip designed and optimized for Java
workloads. The Azul virtual machine can accommodate hundreds of processor
cores and up-to-670 GB of memory. It supports hardware-assisted pauseless
garbage collection and optimisitic thread concurrency which minimizes the
impact of scalability bottlenecks caused by synchronization of local
contentions. 


\subsection{Generational pauseless garbage collection}
Azul developed {\em Azul Memory Module\/} which is to be plugged into Linux
kernel and provide virtual and physical memory extensions to deliver the
performance enough to deliver ``pauseless'' garbage collection.
