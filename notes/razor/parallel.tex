\section{MPI (Message Passing Interface)}
The MPI is a specification of a set of functions
which specifies which specifies names, calling sequences, and passing results
of functions in languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. 
Typically, MPI is implemented in a library which is linked with user programs.

\subsection{Message-passing model of parallel computation}
In message-passing model of parallel computation, processes executing in
parallel have separate address spaces. Communication happens when a portion of
one process's address space is copied into another process's address space.
