\section{Java Memory Model}
The \bb{memory model}, or \bb{memory consistency model}, defines {\em the
  set of values that a READ in a program is allowed to return\/}, thereby
defining the basic semantics of shared variables~\cite{AB10}. This model
answers questions such as:
  \bit
  \w Is there enough synchronization to ensure a thread's write will occur
  before another's read?
  \w Can two threads write to adjacent fields in a memory location at the same
  time? 
  \w Must the final value of a location always be one of those written to it?
  \eit
The memory model defines an {\em interface between a program and any
  hardware or software (e.g. compiler, virtual machine, dynamic optimizer)
  that transform that program\/}.  A memory model should not overly
restrictive to prohibit optimizations or too weak to allow wrong compuation.
